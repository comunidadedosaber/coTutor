# Description
The <b>coTutor</b> is a web system that aims to automate all possible steps from management to the publication of end-of-course papers (TCC), this control is done by registering topics, students, coordinators, tutors and activities. Aiming to provide greater control of scientific projects and academic activities, in addition to bringing greater benefits in the resolution of doubts and feedback, facilitating access to information among those involved in the activities.

## Problematic
<ul>
<li>Currently, some educational institutions do not have a computerized system to assist in the management of TCC processes, all control and management of the institution's work is carried out manually, in some cases with the aid of a computational tool such as text editors, electronic spreadsheets and even handwritten agendas.</li>
<li>Furthermore, without an adequate system for managing the TCC, it is difficult to measure the progress of each process, making it difficult to monitor activities. For example, in order to know the number of TCC projects that have been started and how many proposals have been approved, it is necessary to consult a series of files and documents to then carry out this accounting.</li>
<li>These forms and documents needed to be kept in some cases with copies for future consultations, this causes the allocation of physical space for this purpose to increase exponentially every school year. This manual management also makes consultation difficult, as the time spent looking for a particular document is too much and in some cases unnecessary, compared to the time spent searching if there were a computer system for managing scientific projects.</li> 
<li>Students who take the TCC disciplines and their respective advisors often need to consult documents, calendars and schedules to know the delivery dates of the activities inherent to the TCC, without a specialized system it is necessary to go to the institution to then deliver documents and stay informed.</li>
</ul>

<b>This system aims to respond to these identified problems that most teaching institutions in Angola face.</b>
